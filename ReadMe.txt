This is a neural network model that classify planer data. This was developed using python and its popular libraries like numpy,sklearn and matplotlib.
    Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
    Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
    Compute the cross entropy loss
    Implement forward and backward propagation
